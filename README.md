A-Survival-Game-for-A-Little-Box
================================

Conference project for Intro to CS, Sarah Lawrence College
My conference project is a little game. When you start the game, the program creates a window. Inside that window, 
you can see a box, walls, and floors. The user can press different keys in the keyboard to move the box and to do 
other interactive things with the program. The goal of this game is to try to move the box to the highest floor. 
The game has 3 different levels, and the difficulty increases the higher the level is. Different levels will have 
different number of floors, but the goal is always to move the box to the top floor. Finishing all three levels will 
be considered as a completion of the game. 

This game is coded using Calico library, language Python. I mainly use the Calico Graphics library's feature “Physics mode”
in order to do the animation.
